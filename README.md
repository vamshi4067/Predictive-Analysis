# Predictive Modeling on Youngster’s Age

# Abstract

The dataset “Young People Survey” consists of data about the habits and survey about the interests of the students at a university in the U.K. This gives you detailed information about the demographics, spending habits, personality traits, views on life and opinions, health habits, phobias, hobbies and interests, movie preferences and music preferences. These features can be used to cluster data of similar behavior, hypothesis testing, visualization, predictive modelling etc.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle which has 1010 rows and 150 columns. This data was collected by the students of Statistics class at FSEV UK as a part of the survey. This dataset has 139 numerical columns and 11 categorical columns, where the entire data set is divided into 8 groups where each group contain certain number of columns in it and each group represent different categories or interests of the students.

# Conclusion

Hence, when the project was viewed in terms of a predictive model building; machine learning algorithms of both regression and classification models were implemented. Regression model, when implemented with pre-processed attributes, gives better results than the one with actual attributes. Regression models show a higher accuracy of predicting the age and ensemble 4 models by creating an upper-level regression model provided enhanced results with lower root mean square error values. An attempt has been made to perform classification analysis and this project has a future scope of improving the classification error rate.

While looking in the view of the dataset, we can conclude that awareness for education has been improved at a higher rate. Students improving their educational standards by not just stopping at secondary education. Secondly, the opinion for elections was changing time to time in a student life cycle. They are having different opinions at different phases of their teenage. Flowingly, teens view on gardening and idea of changing the past play a prominent role in identifying the age of an individual.
